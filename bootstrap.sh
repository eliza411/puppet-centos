# It helps to have puppet installed...

# We need rubygem-deep-merge for the 'deeper' merge setting used in Hiera.
# This is provided in the puppetlabs-deps repo. We assume this repo is already
# configured in the base box.

# EL6 has Ruby 1.8, so we need to pull in the latest 1.x version of r10k

# The following is only required on Rackspace.
# Rackspace Vagrant plugin seems to run puppet with /tmp module paths no matter what we configure.
# And the number in the directory /tmp/vagrant-puppet-# seems to change occasionally -- and is not well
# documented in Vagrant or the Rackspace plugin.
# This is a hacky workaround just to get things working without too much effort.
